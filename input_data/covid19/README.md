# Preprocessing COVID-19 datasets

* the file `preprocessing_covid.Rmd` contains the code used to process the scRNA-seq data from [Chua et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0602-4)
* the folder `cpdb_output/` contains 3 CPDB output folders, corresponding to the two COVID-19 conditions (critical and moderate) and the healthy controls. These folders can be used as input to `InterCellar`, as they contain predicted CCI data.
* the file `CPDB_command_line.txt` reports the code used to run CPDB v2.
